Exercise 2(Week 5)
For this exercise, modify the program so that it draws an additional cube above the first one. The top
cube show rotate around the Y axis in one direction and the bottom cube should rotate around the Y
axis in the opposite direction

for 3 
/*_eyePosition = Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, -10.0f);
	_focalPointPosition = Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
	_upVector = Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);*/
	_upVector = Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
	/*_eyePosition = Vector3(0.0f, 5.0f, -5.0f);
	_focalPointPosition = Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);*/

	_eyePosition = Vector3(0.0f, 10.0f, 0.1f);
	_focalPointPosition = Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
